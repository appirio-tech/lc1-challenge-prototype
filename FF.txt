#2 Ie9, schedule-view --> week view, the green bar does not show slider animation when hover on

this cannot be fixed with css and this is not ask in wiki. So i can remove animation in other browser if this not needed.

#5.9 schedule view--week view:
#5.9.1 http://grab.by/yTRq
compare with storyboard, the week view should display only one day event not the week event

This cannot be done with this calendar plugin(week view). If we show one day for week, we can't show other days of week.

#5.9.2 http://grab.by/yTRM
The week date should extend, note the Sunday should align with bottom timeline

this one also couldn't do with this structure


##Position of events is incorrect in Schedule Weekly View.
I mean in calendarEventsList.json.the "Start" is "2014-07-20T00:00:00Z".But the event in screen is in 2014-07-20 08:30:00AM.

this is because time show with adding timezone value to original value.
